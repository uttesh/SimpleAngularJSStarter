 Let’s go over some of the more important things to notice here:
 
 <h5>package.json</h5>
 The package.json file helps npm to identify our project as well as to manage all of it’s dependencies. It can also contain all sorts of other metadata relevant to your project.
 
 <h5>Gruntfile.js</h5>
 The Gruntfile is a javascript file that is responsible for configuring your project as well as any tasks or plugins that your project requires. For instance, your gruntfile might specify that your project uses Uglify and that you want it to run uglify on a particular directory at build time.

 <h5>bower.json / Bower</h5>
Bower is a package manager. It will help us to quickly find and install our favourite CSS frameworks, javascript libraries and plugins with just a few simple commands.
